I think that the following page elements cover all usage cases:
1) nodes
2) blocks
3) views
4) pages (like "layouts")

Also I believe that having multiple _mixins.scss files is better than one big file.
e.g. some mixins used for pages only.
// TODO: sure probably we can use _variables.scss files as well. But I believe all additional variables can be set in mixins.

I make some restrictions on filenames.
I think that all names like node bundles, no view modes, Views names should be written with "-" instead of "_".
"_" will be used to split filenames on "SCSS" logical parts.
For example,

_view_here-goes-view-name.scss
_node_here-goes-node-bundle.scss
_page_here-goes-arg-0_here-goes-arg-1.scss
